# COMP1720 template

Here's the **javascript** template for making p5 sketches for COMP1720. If
you've used Processing before, the p5 function names and general worldview will
be really similar.

## Setup

1. install [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Windows, OSX or Linux)

2. install the [Git Plus](https://atom.io/packages/git-plus)
   and [Live Server](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server) packages (if you
   use the `apm` tool it's just `apm install git-plus atom-live-server`)

## Use

To make things, 

1. clone this repo somewhere

2. and open up the `sketch.js` file in Atom

3. start the "live server" by using the one of the **Atom Live Server: Start
   <port>** commands (doesn't matter which port)

4. every time you save the `sketch.js` file, the live server will auto-update
   the changes in the webpage

### Notes

This should work in all browsers, but we'll be using Chrome in the labs, so
probably best to use that.

Also, if you do make a cool sketch, don't push the changes back up to this
template repo, which should stay "bare". Instead, create a new GitLab repo
(either under the [comp1720 group](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1720) or
somewhere else) and push it up there.
